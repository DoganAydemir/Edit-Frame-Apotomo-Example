At some point I will create a better README.

I developed the plugin I've called edit_frame_widgets within this example app, but have now split it out into its own plugin.
The example app still works, it now just pulls in the plugin instead.

Here's how to make it go:

git clone git://github.com/paulhagstrom/Edit-Frame-Apotomo-Example.git
cd Edit-Frame-Apotomo-Example
git submodule init
git submodule update
rake db:migrate
script/server

Relies on Apotomo, Cells, and edit_frame_widgets.  Uses a sqlite3 database, so it might be Mac-centric.

The edit_frame_widgets generator will create most of this still, but have a look at:

app/models/application_widget_tree.rb

Parent widget:
app/cells/books_cell.rb
app/cells/books/_frame.html.erb
app/cells/books/_detail.html.erb
app/cells/books/_list.html.erb

Subordinate widget:
app/cells/authors_cell.rb
app/cells/authors/_frame.html.erb
app/cells/authors/_detail.html.erb
app/cells/authors/_list.html.erb

Common views:
app/cells/edit_frame/_filter.html.erb
app/cells/edit_frame/_selected.html.erb
app/cells/edit_frame/_message.html.erb


Note that I did this primarily by fiddling, trial-and-error, getting hints from the docs that exist, and deciphering what is actually going on inside apotomo and cells.  I may well be doing something "wrong" here and there, but I at least got it to a point where it appears to work.
